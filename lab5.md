# Part 1
The scenerio I will play out is a student having issues with their tester files from lab3 not testing correctly.

Student:
Hello I am having issues with my testing for my `ArrayExamples` file. I know that it should be failing the following tests but instead I am passing them. What can I do?

TA: 
Okay maybe you should start by checking your `ArrayTests` file to see if there is any bugs. Does anything out of the ordinary catch your eye?

Student:

I see in my `ArrayTests.java` file both of my testing methods have bugs and I think I've fixed them, can you check and let me know?

TA:
It looks a lot better, try running your `bash` script to see if you get the correct output.

Student:
Yes I am getting the correct output now.

TA:
Okay is there anything else I can help you with?

Student:
Nope now I can fix the methods in my `ArrayExamples.java` file accordingly.

TA:
Glad to have helped :)

Here is the directory structure
```
>lab3
  >lib
    hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
    junit-4.13.2.jar
  ArrayExamples.java
  ArrayTests.java
  test.sh
```
# Part 2
I feel like there is so much that I can write about that I've learned throughout this second half of the quarter.
One thing that stands out to me in particular however, is using the java debugger tool, it kinda has helped me a lot in both this class and cse 12 to be able to use it 
whenever I feel like I am stuck and it's a lot quicker than having to check everything manually.
